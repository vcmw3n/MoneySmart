Answer:,,,,,
"Based on the above table on total 4 years of data, November was the month with the highest sales.",,,,,
"Based on the chart above, we can see that the trend generally increased over 1 year, regardless any year. ",,,,,
Hence it shows that the consumers prefer to purchase or spend during the end of the year.,,,,,
That could also due to promotions or festive seasons that moved consumers in purchase in bigger quantities. ,,,,,
